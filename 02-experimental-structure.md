Well-designed experiments can deliver information that has a clear impact on 
human health. The 
[Generation 100 study](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/2/e007519)
evaluated the effects of exercise on more than 1500 elderly Norwegians from
Trondheim, Norway, to determine if exercise led to a longer active and healthy
life. Specifically the researchers investigated the relationship between
exercise intensity and health and longevity. One group performed high-intensity
interval training (10 minute warm-up followed by four 4-minute intervals at ∼90%
of peak heart rate) twice a week for five years. A second group performed
moderate exercise twice a week (50 minutes of continuous exercise at ∼70% of
peak heart rate). A third control group followed physical activity advice
according to national recommendations.
Clinical examinations and questionnaires were administered to all at the start
and after one, three, and five years. Heart rate, blood pressure, leg and grip
strength, cognitive function, and other health indicators were measured during
clinical exams.

## Challenge 1: Raw ingredients of a comparative experiment

Discuss the following questions with your partner, then share your answers
to each question in the collaborative document.

1. What is the research question in this study? If you prefer to name a
  hypothesis, turn the research question into a declarative statement.
2. What is the treatment (treatment factor)? How many levels are there for
  this treatment factor?
3. What are the experimental units (the entities to which treatments are
  applied)?
4. What are the responses (the measurements used to determine treatment
  effects)?
5. Should participants have been allowed to choose which group
  (high-intensity, moderate exercise, or national standard) they wanted to
  join? Why or why not? Should the experimenters have assigned participants
  to treatment groups based on their judgment of each participant's
  characteristics? Why or why not?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The research question asked whether exercise, specifically high-intensity
exercise, would affect healthspan and lifespan of elderly Norwegians. The
treatments were high-intensity, moderate-intensity, and national standard
exercise groups. The experimental units are the individuals. The responses
measured were heart rate, blood pressure, strength, cognitive function and
other health indicators. The main response measured was 5-year survival.
If participants had been allowed to choose their preferred exercise group
or if experimenters had chosen the groups based on participant
characteristics, extraneous variables (e.g. state of depression or anxiety) 
could be introduced into the study. When participants are randomly assigned to
treatment groups, these variables are spread across the groups and cancel
out. Furthermore, if experimenters had used their own judgment to assign
participants to groups, their own biases could have affected the results.

### Conducting a Comparative Experiment

Comparative experiments apply treatments to experimental units and measure the
responses, then compare the responses to those treatments with statistical
analysis. If in the Generation 100 study the experimenters had only one group
(e.g. high-intensity training), they might have achieved good results but would 
have no way of knowing if either of the other treatments would have achieved the 
same or even better results. To know whether high-intensity training is better 
than moderate or low-intensity training, it was necessary to run experiments in 
which some experimental units engaged in high-intensity training, others in 
moderate, and others still in low-intensity training. Only then can the 
responses to those treatments be statistically analyzed to determine treatment effects.

## Challenge 2: Which are the experimental units?

Identify the experimental units in each experiment described below, then share
your answers in the collaborative document.

1. Three hundred mice are individually housed in the same room. Half of them
  are fed a high-fat diet and the other half are fed regular chow.
2. Three hundred mice are housed five per cage in the same room. Half of them
  are fed a high-fat diet and the other half are fed regular chow.
3. Three hundred mice are individually housed in two different rooms. Those in
  the first room are fed a high-fat diet and those in the other room are fed
  regular chow.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

1. The individual animal is the experimental unit.

2. The cage receives the treatment and is the experimental unit.

3. The room receives the treatment and is the experimental unit.

### Reducing Bias with Randomization and Blinding

Randomized studies assign experimental units to treatment groups randomly by
pulling a number out of a hat or using a computer's random number generator. The
main purpose for *randomization* comes later during statistical analysis, where
we compare the data we have with the data distribution we might have obtained
by random chance. Randomization provides us a way to create the distribution of 
data we might have obtained and ensures that our comparisons between treatment 
groups are valid. Random assignment (*allocation*) of experimental units to 
treatment groups prevents the subjective bias that might be introduced by an 
experimenter who selects, even in good faith and with good intention, which 
experimental units should get which treatment. For example, if the experimenter 
selected which people would do high-, moderate- and low-intensity training they 
might unconsciously bias the groups by body size or shape. This *selection bias* 
would influence the outcome of the experiment.

Randomization also accounts for or cancels out effects of "nuisance" variables 
like the time or day of the experiment, the investigator or technician, 
equipment calibration, exposure to light or ventilation in animal rooms, or 
other variables that are not being studied but that do influence the responses. Randomization balances out the effects of nuisance variables between treatment 
groups by giving an equal probability for an experimental unit to be assigned to 
any treatment group.

*Blinding* (also known as masking) prevents the experimenter from influencing 
the outcome of an experiment to suit their expectations or preferred hypothesis.
Ideally experimenters should not know which treatment the experimental units
have received or will receive from the beginning through to the statistical 
analysis stage of the experiment. This might require additional personnel like 
technicians or other colleagues to perform some tasks, and should be planned 
during experimental design. If ideal circumstances can't be arranged, it should 
be possible to carry out at least some of the stages blind. Blinding during
allocation (assignment of experimental units to treatment groups), treatment,
data collection or data analysis can reduce experimental bias.

## Challenge 3: How does bias enter an experiment?

Identify ways that bias enters into each experiment described below, then
share your answers in the collaborative document.

1. A clinician perceives increased aggression in subjects given testosterone.
2. A clinician concludes that mood of each subject has improved in the
  treatment group given a new antidepressant.
3. A researcher unintentionally treats subjects differently based on their
  treatment group by providing more food to control group animals.
4. A clinician gives different nonverbal cues to patients in the treatment
  group of a clinical trial than to the control group patients.
