## Design issues

Imagine that you want to evaluate the effect of different 
doses of a new drug on the proliferation of cancer cell lines in vitro. You use
four different cancer cell lines because you would like the results to 
generalize to many types of cell lines. Divide each of the cell lines into four 
treatment groups, each with the same number of cells. Each treatment group
receives a different dose of the drug for five consecutive days.

Group 1: Control (no drug)  
Group 2: Low dose (10 μM) 
Group 3: Medium dose (50 μM) 
Group 4: High dose (100 μM) 


~~~
# create treatment levels
f <- factor(c("control", "low", "medium", "high"))

# create random orderings of the treatment levels
block1 <- sample(f, 4)
block2 <- sample(f, 4)
block3 <- sample(f, 4)
block4 <- sample(f, 4)
treatment <- c(block1, block2, block3, block4)
block <- factor(rep(c("cellLine1", "cellLine2", "cellLine3", "cellLine4"), each = 4))
dishnum <- rep(1:4, 4)
plan <- data.frame(cellLine = block, DishNumber = dishnum, treatment = treatment)
plan

When analyzing a random complete block design, the effect of the block is 
included in the equation along with the effect of the treatment.
