Statistical experimental design and data analysis fundamentals provide the 
background needed to plan, execute, and analyze experiments effectively. Data

using standard experimental designs illuminate concepts and place these designs 
in a real-world context. After completing this course, participants will be able 
to develop rigorous experimental designs that produce high-quality data.
