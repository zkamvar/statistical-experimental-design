:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What is gained from good experimental design?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Good experimental design generates information-rich data with a clear message. 
In both scientific research and industry, experimental design plays a critical 
role in obtaining reliable and meaningful results. Scientists can better 
understand their work when they carry out well-conceived, well-executed 
experiments and then extract, communicate, and act on information generated in 
those experiments. This course will prepare scientists to design rigorous 
experiments that generate high-value data and to extract and communicate its 
messages. By applying statistical concepts in designing experiments, 
understanding variability, and drawing meaningful inferences, participants will
be equipped with the knowledge and skills for data-driven decision-making.

Experimental design aims to describe and explain variation in natural systems by
intervening to affect that variation directly. For example, the Salk polio 
vaccine trials collected data about variation in polio incidence after injecting 
more than 600,000 schoolchildren with vaccine or placebo. This clinical trial
hypothesized that the vaccine would reduce the incidence of polio in 
schoolchildren. More than a million additional children were vaccinated and 
served as observed controls. The results showed evidence that the vaccine was
80-90% effective in preventing polio.
